	I am trying to make a windows. Application
with C# that has buttons to control Spotify (externally).

	I found this code but what it does is that it uses the windows shortcuts (for example the Volume down
makes the whole windows volume lower and not the Spotify volume), is there any other way to control the
Volume and so on that are inside Spotify?
